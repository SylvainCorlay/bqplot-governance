# Bqplot Code of Conduct - Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by Bqplot. It is used when we respond to an incident to make sure we are consistent and fair.

## The Code of Conduct Committee

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by the Bqplot Steering Council, which serves as the Bqplot Code of Conduct Committee ("the Committee").

If a Code of Conduct report involves a member of the Steering Council, that member will not participate in the investigation or any decisions related to that report.

## Enforcement guidelines and principles

Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the future.
It is an action that we do not take lightly.

The priority of the Committee is the safety and the well-being of the community members (maintainers, contributors, users) who engage on the different forums (GitHub, Gitter, mailing lists, events). Committee members and other community leaders may act swiftly if they discover abusive behavior or content that is strongly in contradiction with the environment that we want to foster.

Should a leader of the community act swiftly, they must report promptly to the steering council on the breach to the code of conduct and their actions.

The Code of Conduct Committee will keep the following values and guidelines in mind:

* Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal.  The Committee can engage
  the parties to understand the situation, while respecting the privacy and any
  necessary confidentiality of reporters.  However, sometimes it is necessary
  to communicate with one or more individuals directly: the Committee's goal is
  to improve the health of our community rather than only produce a formal
  decision.

* Emphasize empathy for individuals rather than judging behavior, avoiding
  binary labels of "good" and "bad/evil". Overt, clear-cut aggression and
  harassment exists and will be addressed unambiguously.  But many scenarios
  that can prove challenging to resolve are those where normal disagreements
  devolve into inappropriate behavior from multiple parties.  Understanding the
  full context and finding a path that re-engages all is hard, but ultimately
  the most productive for our community.

* Help increase engagement in good discussion practice: try to identify where
  discussion may have broken down and provide actionable information, pointers
  and resources that can help enact positive change on these points.

* Be mindful of the needs of new members: provide them with explicit support
  and consideration, with the aim of increasing participation from
  underrepresented groups in particular.

* Individuals come from different cultural backgrounds and native languages.
  While lack of intent to harm is not an excuse, try to identify any honest
  misunderstandings caused by a non-native speaker and help them understand the
  issue and how to change.  Complex discussion in a foreign language can be
  very intimidating, and we want to grow our diversity also across
  nationalities and cultures.

* Our actions will reflect compassion for all individuals. We will seek to
  understand, to educate, and, as necessary, take action.

We value the health of the community over individual contributions.

## How the Committee will respond to incidents

When the Committee is made aware of an incident, they will promptly reply to the reporter to confirm receipt.

The Committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* Who are the responsible party(ies).
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
group's deliberations will be recorded and retained (e.g. email discussions, meeting minutes, etc.). 


## Resolutions

The Committee will strive to achieve a quick resolution of reported issues. The Committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action
  - if we determine no violations have occurred.
  - if the matter has been resolved publicly while the Committee was
    considering responses.
* Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language have been
  judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can be hurtful to
  some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.
* A private reprimand from the Committee to the individual(s) involved. In this
  case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over
  email, cc'ing the group.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the Committee chair will deliver that
  reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within the limits of
  practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an email violation, but
  for a chat room discussion where the person/context may be gone, they can be
  reached by other means. The group may choose to publish this message
  elsewhere for documentation purposes.
* A "mutually agreed upon hiatus" where the Committee asks the individual to
  temporarily refrain from community participation. If the individual chooses
  not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the Committee may issue a
  "mandatory cooling off period".
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all bqplot spaces (mailing lists,
  chat channels, etc.).

The Committee has the option to publish official public statements if judged necessary, but generally will pursue resolutions confidentially.

## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of a conflict of interest, a Committee member must immediately
notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
